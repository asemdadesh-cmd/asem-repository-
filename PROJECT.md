## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** A Claude Code configuration repository. Its current deliverable
  is the **`agency-review` skill** — a reusable skill that turns Claude into an
  elite web-agency review board for building and shipping websites.
- **Business goals:** Let the owner produce premium, production-ready websites
  on demand without re-pasting a long review framework each time. Raise the
  quality bar (design, copy, UX, SEO, accessibility, performance, security) of
  every web deliverable.
- **Target users:** The repository owner (NHT Estates) and any collaborator who
  runs Claude Code in this repo. End beneficiaries are the clients whose
  websites/landing pages get built through the skill.
- **Current status:** ✅ Active. The `agency-review` skill is implemented and
  pushed on branch `claude/agency-review-framework-3a8hk8`. Living
  documentation (this file + TASKS.md + DECISIONS.md) being established now.

## Architecture

- **System architecture:** No runtime application. This is a
  **configuration/knowledge repository** consumed by the Claude Code agent. The
  "logic" lives in Markdown skill files that Claude loads on demand.
- **Technology stack:**
  - Claude Code skills (Markdown + YAML frontmatter)
  - Git / GitHub for versioning
  - No build system, package manager, database, or server (yet)
- **Folder structure:**
  ```
  .
  ├── PROJECT.md                     # this file — living project docs
  ├── TASKS.md                       # completed / in-progress / planned work
  ├── DECISIONS.md                   # major technical decisions + rationale
  ├── README.md                      # repo intro + agency-review usage
  └── .claude/
      └── skills/
          └── agency-review/
              ├── SKILL.md           # review framework + 13 specialist roles
              └── reference/
                  ├── checklist.md   # final pass/fail approval checklist
                  └── rewrite-guide.md  # copywriting & conversion patterns
  ```
- **Design decisions (summary — full rationale in DECISIONS.md):**
  - Skill lives at **project** scope (`.claude/skills/`) so it ships with the
    repo; can be promoted to global `~/.claude/skills/` if desired.
  - The main `SKILL.md` is kept concise for reliable triggering; heavy detail
    is split into `reference/` files that load on demand.

## Features

- **Completed features**
  - `agency-review` skill with 13 specialist review roles, brutally-honest
    critic pass, innovation pass, and final approval checklist.
  - `reference/checklist.md` — production-readiness pass/fail list.
  - `reference/rewrite-guide.md` — copywriting & conversion patterns.
  - README documenting purpose and usage.
  - Living documentation system (PROJECT.md / TASKS.md / DECISIONS.md).
- **Features in progress**
  - Establishing auto-update discipline for the documentation files.
- **Planned features**
  - Optional CLAUDE.md instruction (or hook) so docs update automatically on
    every meaningful change.
  - Optional promotion of the skill to global scope.
- **Backlog**
  - Example/generated website outputs stored under a `sites/` or `examples/`
    directory.
  - A dedicated `website-scaffold` skill for consistent starter structure.

## Database

- **Not applicable.** The project has no database. (Section retained so it can
  be filled in if a data-backed website/app is added later.)
- Tables / Relationships / Schema / Indexes / Migrations: _none yet._

---

## APIs

- **Not applicable.** No API is defined or served by this repository.
- Endpoints / Authentication / Request & response examples / Error codes:
  _none yet._

---

## Authentication & Permissions

- **Application-level auth:** _none_ (no app yet).
- **Repository access:** GitHub repo `asemdadesh-cmd/asem-repository-`.
  Development happens on branch `claude/agency-review-framework-3a8hk8`.
- User roles / permission matrix / security model: _defined per website when one
  is built; not applicable to the repo itself._

---

## Environment

- **Required environment variables:** _none._
- **Third-party services:** GitHub (hosting/version control); Claude Code (the
  agent that consumes the skill).
- **Setup instructions:**
  1. Clone the repo.
  2. Open it with Claude Code.
  3. The `agency-review` skill auto-loads; trigger it by asking to build/design
     a website, or invoke `/agency-review` explicitly.

---

## Deployment

- **Build instructions:** _none required_ — Markdown skill files need no build.
- **Deployment steps:** Commit and push to the working branch
  (`git push -u origin claude/agency-review-framework-3a8hk8`). The skill is
  "deployed" simply by being present in `.claude/skills/`.
- **Hosting configuration:** _N/A for the repo._ Websites built with the skill
  are hosted per-project (documented in this file when that happens).

---

## Known Issues

- **Bugs:** None known.
- **Technical debt:** Documentation currently updated manually; no automated
  enforcement that it stays in sync with changes.
- **Limitations:** The skill is scoped to this repository only; it does not
  activate in other projects unless promoted to global scope.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Recommended enhancements:** Add a CLAUDE.md rule or hook to keep
  PROJECT.md / TASKS.md / DECISIONS.md updated automatically.
- **Performance optimizations:** N/A until a real website/app exists here.
- **Scalability ideas:** Split additional skills into their own folders under
  `.claude/skills/` as the toolkit grows.

---

## Changelog

- **2026-07-04** — Added living documentation system: created PROJECT.md,
  TASKS.md, and DECISIONS.md (three-file structure per owner request).
- **2026-07-04** — Created the `agency-review` skill (SKILL.md +
  reference/checklist.md + reference/rewrite-guide.md) and README; pushed to
  `claude/agency-review-framework-3a8hk8`.

---

## Development Notes

- This repo is **documentation/configuration, not application code** — there is
  intentionally no database, API, or server. Keep the "Database"/"APIs"/"Auth"
  sections as placeholders so they're ready if a real website/app is added.
- Skill design principle: keep `SKILL.md` short and trigger-focused; push detail
  into `reference/` files that Claude loads only when needed.
- When you build an actual website through the `agency-review` skill, record its
  stack, structure, environment, and deployment **in this file** so PROJECT.md
  stays the single source of truth.
- To make documentation self-maintaining, add an instruction in `CLAUDE.md`
  telling Claude to update these three files after any meaningful change.
